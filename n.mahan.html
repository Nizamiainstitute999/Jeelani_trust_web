        What we need to do is to regain the original purity of our hearts and become truly human. Only then can we die
        happily as humans with clarity. What I am showing you is the way up there. Quthbuzzaman has shown us the path to
        elevate those who approach with sincere intention, by nurturing the divine qualities within, and lead them to
        the
        lofty state of being God's most excellent creation. That is what I continue to do. It is the method of spiritual
        purification that will continue until the Day of Judgment. Quthbuzzaman taught us to look at the heart of a
        person, regardless of caste or creed. It is when one attains that blessed state of mind that one achieves
        complete
        success in life. That is what I guarantee.

      In the sacred chain (‘silsila’) of Qadiri Sufi masters, following the founding father Hazrat Quthbuzzaman’s Sufi
      path of spiritual awakening in the tradition of Tawhid and the luminous light (‘Nur’) of the holy Prophetic (peace
      and blessings be upon him), Sufi Guru Hazrat Naeb Quthbuzzaman Dr. Shaikh Nizamuddin Sulthan Shah Qadiri Chishti
      stands as the 36th spiritual successor of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), and was chosen as the 19th Sufi descendant of
      Ghaus al-A’zam Sheikh ‘Muhyiddin’ Abdul Qadir al-Jeelani (may he be blessed), the supreme master and the founder
      of Qadiri Sufi path, established in early medieval Baghdad – in present-day Iraq. Taking forward Hazrat
      Quthbuzzaman’s phenomenal mission of reviving the pristine human spirit of din (religion) and illuminating the
      divine Light of the Holy Prophet (pbuh) in the human hearts, Hazrat Naeb Quthbuzzaman Sheikh Nizamudhin Sulthan
      insists on reviving the more amicable life style of traditional Islam, the foundation of which is Sufi path,
      grounded in tawhid (divine unity), tasawwuf (spiritual purity), guided by sunnah (close adherence to the pious
      traditions of the Prophet - pbuh). Countering and correcting the divisive ideologies of politically motivated
      fundamentalists and modernist religious extremists, Sheikh Nizamudhin Sulthan Shah faithfully follows in the
      footsteps of Hazrat Quthbuzzaman’s cherished Sufi tradition and humanitarian teachings. He seeks to revive the
      essential Sufi vitality of Islamic tradition, acclaimed for its clarity in envisioning humanity and practical
      ability to spiritually reunify human societies, transcending socio-political divisions and cultural distances.
